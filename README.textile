h2. Tag and build yum packages in Koji massively with ease

Ever been through the pain of having to build in koji tens of packages? 
Fear no more. Invoke Kura and it will help you out.

To build ONE package: 
<pre> $ kura package-1.0.0-0.src.rpm --owner someone --tags tag1 tag2 </pre>

To build several packages: 
<pre> $ kura directory_with_packages --owner=someone --tags tag1 tag2 </pre>
If you don't specify any owner/tags, Kura will ask you for them for each of your packages.
                                            

- Why is this called Kura? Because Kura stands for "sake brewery" in Japanese. 
  Local Kuras dedicate special rooms to grow their Koji in the nicest rooms.
