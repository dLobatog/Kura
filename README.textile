h2. Tag and build yum packages in Koji massively with ease

Ever been through the pain of having to build in koji packages with tens of
dependencies? Fear no more. Invoke Kura and it will help you out.

To build ONE package: 
<pre> $ kura package-1.0.0-0.src.rpm --owner=someone --tags=tag1 tag2 </pre>
If you don't specify any owner/tags, Kura will ask you for them for your package.

To build several packages: 
First, put them all in a directory.
<pre> $ kura directory_with_packages --owner=someone --tags=tag1 tag2 </pre>
If you don't specify any owner/tags, Kura will ask you for them for each of your packages.
